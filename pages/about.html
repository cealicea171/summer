  <p class="dadsection"> Luckily, growing up I had both parents in my household when but I was 16 years old in my junior year of highschool, my father passed away. My life and my family fell apart. I dropped out of school and did absolutely nothing.
    As time went by, I realized I had to live for him. I got back into school and now I'm here...at Thaddues Stevens College of Technology. On May 9th I will be walking the stage to get my associates degree in computer software engineering. My new
    passion❤️</p>
