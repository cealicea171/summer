      <p class="dadsection"> Growing up I was very lucky. I had both parents in my household. Unfornuately, when I was 16 years old; in my junior year of highschool, my father passed away. My life and my family fell apart. Losing the rock of my family
      was the hardest
      thing that I've went through. I dropped out of school and did absolutely nothing. As time went by, I realized I had to live for him. I got back into school and now I'm here...at Thaddues Stevens College of Technology. On May 9th I will be walking the stage to get my associates degree in computer software engineering. My new passion, my purpose.❤️</p>
